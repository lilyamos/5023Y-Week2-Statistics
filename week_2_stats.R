### a linear model that analyses a dependent variable (height) as a function of

### sets the factor levels 

lm(height~type, data=darwin_relevel)
### states the new intercept and difference between the means

summary(model2)
### produces all test statistics

### intercept: mean value of one of the groups (whichever is 1st alphabetically)

### estimate: value of the intercept, and the difference between other 
### treatments and the intercept

### standard error: Standard error of the mean for the intercept and standard 
### error of the difference between the means

### degrees of freedom: number of values which are free to move while the mean
### stays the same. In essence it is n-the freedoms required for a particular
### test and is required to calculate probability from the test-statistic

### test statistics:F - the signal-to-noise ratio or Sum of squares/sum of 
### square errors. t-tests are carried out for each independent variable in the 
### ANOVA - here you can see that there is only one variable and the p-value 
### from the t-test and the F-test are the same. For simplicity F=t2.

### P-values: The probability of observing this signal-to-noise ratio at this 
### sample size if the null hypothesis were true

anova_test(height~type, data=darwin)
### performing a linear model when the independent variable is categorical 
### (a factor) is the same as running an ANOVA

pf(q=5.9395, df1=1, df2=28, lower.tail=FALSE)
### calculates probability of observing this signal-to-noise ratio with this 
### sample size

### write up: The cross-fertilised plants were taller on average than the 
### self-fertilised plants with a mean of 20.2 inches compared to 17.5 inches; 
### F1,28= 5.94, P = 0.02.
